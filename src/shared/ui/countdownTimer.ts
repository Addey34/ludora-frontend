/**
 * Generic one-second countdown timer — the shared primitive behind any "time
 * left" readout (Typing's game chrono, Ludo's per-turn timer…).
 *
 * It owns only the `setInterval` lifecycle and the remaining-seconds bookkeeping;
 * the **caller owns the display** (via {@link CountdownOptions.onTick}) and what
 * happens at zero (via {@link CountdownOptions.onExpire}), so each game keeps its
 * own format (a bare number, `⏱ 12s`, a `.is-low` warning class…) without
 * re-hand-rolling the timer. This mirrors the rest of the shared layer (e.g.
 * `dice.ts`: the helper drives the mechanics, the game owns the rendering).
 *
 * Note this is **not** {@link runCountdown} (`ui/countdown.ts`) — that one is the
 * 3 · 2 · 1 · GO kickoff *overlay*; this is the live in-game timer.
