/**
 * Generic turn-based, N-player game model — the turn-based counterpart of
 * {@link GameEngine} (which targets real-time games like Snake or Pong).
 *
 * A board game supplies only its **rules** through {@link TurnRules}: an opaque
 * game `State`, the set of `Move`s legal for the player whose turn it is, and a
 * pure reducer that advances the state. Everything reusable across board games —
 * seat rotation, filling empty seats with bots, and (Tranche 2) the
 * host-authoritative networking over `net/match.ts` — lives on top of this and
 * never needs to know a game's specific rules.
 *
 * Keeping `State`/`Move` pure (no DOM, no time) makes the rules unit-testable in
 * isolation, exactly like `levels.ts` or the bot views.
