/**
 * Shared pointer control for paddle games (Breakout, Pong).
 *
 * Improves on a naive `board.pointermove` listener in two ways:
 *  - it tracks on `window`, so the paddle keeps following the cursor even when
 *    it leaves the square board (the letterbox margins in fullscreen, or the
 *    area next to the board) — the old listener went silent off-board, freezing
 *    the paddle;
 *  - optional **Pointer Lock**: a mouse click on the board captures the cursor
 *    inside the game and the paddle is then driven by relative `movementX/Y`, for
 *    an arcade feel without the cursor escaping to the screen edges; Esc releases
 *    it (works fullscreen or windowed). Touch is unaffected — it keeps absolute
 *    tracking while dragging. Hovering already moves the paddle (the cursor stays
 *    visible); the click only adds the capture.
 *
 * The caller stays in its own logical units: the helper reports a board-local
 * ratio (0..1 along `axis`) and reads the current ratio back to apply relative
 * (locked) motion, so the caller's own clamp naturally bounds the accumulation.
