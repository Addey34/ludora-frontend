/**
 * Connect 4 — pure rules (no DOM, no time, no randomness), so the whole game
 * logic is unit-testable in isolation (`connect4.test.ts`). Plugs into the
 * generic turn-based engine (`shared/turn/turnGame.ts`) as a {@link TurnRules};
 * the controller (`Connect4Game`) owns the rendering and the turn pacing.
 *
 * Two players drop discs into a 7-wide × 6-tall grid; a disc falls to the lowest
 * free cell of its column. First to line up **four** of their discs — horizontal,
 * vertical or diagonal — wins. A full board with no line is a draw (represented as
 * `winner === null` with no legal moves left, which the controller detects).
 *
 * The board is stored **by column** (`columns[c]` = discs from the bottom up),
 * which mirrors the "drop" move exactly: a move just pushes onto a column.
