/**
 * Ludo bot — the turn-based `decideMove` reserved for board games.
 *
 * It scores each legal move and, dosed by the shared {@link Difficulty}, either
 * plays the best one or a random one (reusing `bot/difficulty.ts`'s `rollChase`,
 * exactly like the real-time bots vary how often they play "smart"):
 *  - `easy`   : always a random legal move;
 *  - `medium` : the best move ~55% of the time, otherwise random;
 *  - `hard`   : always the best move.
 *
 * Move value (pure, from simulating the move): capturing an opponent ≫ finishing
 * a horse > leaving the stable > raw progress. Good enough to feel like a real
 * opponent without a full search.
