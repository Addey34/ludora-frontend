/**
 * Ludo (known in French as "petits chevaux") — pure rules (no DOM, no
 * randomness, no time), so the whole game logic is unit-testable in isolation.
 * Plugs into the generic turn-based engine (`shared/turn/turnGame.ts`) as a
 * {@link TurnRules}; the controller (`LudoGame`) owns the dice rolls and the
 * on-screen animation.
 *
 * Standard "most people" rules (variants will later be opt-in settings):
 *  - 4 seats × 4 horses, each starting in its stable.
 *  - A horse leaves the stable only on a rolled **6**, onto its start cell.
 *  - Rolling a **6** lets the same seat roll again.
 *  - A horse advances by the die along the shared 52-cell ring, then turns into
 *    its own 6-cell home column; the last home cell (the centre) is "finished".
 *  - Landing **exactly** on an opponent sends that horse back to its stable;
 *    you may **never** land on your own horse (that move is illegal — play
 *    another horse, or pass if none can move).
 *  - The **exact** count is required to finish (no overshoot).
 *  - First seat to bring all 4 horses home wins.
 *
 * Dice handling: the rolled value lives in `state.die` (set by the controller
 * via {@link applyRoll}); `die === null` means "this seat must roll first". This
 * keeps {@link applyMove} deterministic — the only randomness, the roll, stays
 * in the controller where an injectable rng makes it testable too.
