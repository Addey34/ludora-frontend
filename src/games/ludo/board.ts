/**
 * Ludo board geometry — the mapping from the abstract rules (a horse's distance
 * `d` along its path) to a cell `[row, col]` on the classic 15×15 cross board.
 *
 * Kept separate from the rules (`ludo.ts`) and pure, so the layout can be
 * unit-tested on its own: `board.test.ts` checks the ring is a continuous,
 * closed 52-cell loop and that each home lane connects to it. This catches a
 * mistyped coordinate automatically, without having to look at the board.
 *
 * Conventions: 15×15 grid, `[row, col]` 0-indexed from the top-left. The four
 * seats sit left / top / right / bottom (clockwise), each entering the ring at
 * `entryCell(seat) = seat*13`, which is exactly `RING_PATH[seat*13]`.
